== Description ==
EU Cookie Compliance displays a banner to new visitors telling them about your sites use of cookies and either taking their implied consent or requiring their acceptance based on your preference.

The banner is a section and as such can be moved around your page and placed exactly where you want it. After a user has accepted (or seen it once) the banner will disappear only to be seen again in a years time (to allow your visitors to reconsider).

Place it where you want on your page

This section is designed only to *help you meet EU regulations* and *does not ensure you are compliant* (please see <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/for_organisations/privacy_and_electronic_communications/the_guide/cookies.aspx">ICO</a> for more details). Each site has different requirements based on what they store in cookies and you will need to have a page explaining the implications of cookies in more detail.
